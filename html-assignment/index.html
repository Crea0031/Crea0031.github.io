        <h1> About Me!</h1>
        <p>My name is David <em>"Dave"</em> Crean and I was born in Ireland, but currently reside in Toronto, Canada. This is my 4<sup>th</sup> year in Toronto and have made some wonderful memories during the years but I hope to move to Ottawa to start a new adventure. 
          I am passionate about technology, digital design and woodwork. I have exceptional experience in IT support, specifically focused on Apple devices. 
          I am certified as an Apple iOS and Mac technician. I have an undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering from the Waterford Institute of Technology 
          and I am currently pursuing an Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College. 
        </p>

          This quote resinates with me as it has given me the confidence to change my career. Rather than just thinking about it, I enrolled in college. In this Interactive Media Design course I hope to improve my photography skills and develop skills in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and User Experience.  
          I hope to pair my theoretical engineering knowledge with practical skills from the design program to create excellent websites, 
          apps and overall user experience.
