        <h1> About Me!</h1>
        <p>My name is David "Dave" Crean and I was born in Ireland, but moved to Canada 4 years ago. 
          I am passionate about technology, digital design and woodwork. I have exceptional experience in IT support, specifically focused on Apple devices. 
          I am certified as an Apple iOS and Mac technician. I have an undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering from the Waterford Institute of Technology 
          and I am currently pursuing an Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College. 
        </p> 
        <p>
          I hope to improve my photography skills and develop skills in web development and User Experience over the next 2 years.  
          I hope to pair my theoretical engineering knowledge with practical skills from the design program to create excellent websites, 
          apps and overall user experience.
